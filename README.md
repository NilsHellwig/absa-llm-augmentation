# Master Thesis: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis - Generating Data with Large Language Models

## About

This repository contains the code and resources related to my Master Thesis on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and the generation of synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs). ABSA is a critical task in natural language processing that involves identifying and analyzing sentiments expressed towards specific aspects or entities within a given text.

In this thesis, I explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models, such as GPT-3.5 or Llama2 to generate synthetic data for aspect-based sentiment analysis. By utilizing the power of LLMs, my aim is to augment the existing labeled datasets and improve the performance of ABSA models in real-world scenarios where labeled data may be limited.
